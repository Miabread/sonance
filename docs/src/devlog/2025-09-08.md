Converting this repository from solely housing the "book" into being a general purpose monorepo for the project. It makes sense I feel to keep everything in once spot, and the existing "book" is enough of a something to work from. Speaking of that, the "book" has gone from purely design notes to general purpose documentation. Now housing the starts of a bibliography (that I desperately need to organize), as well as this devlog, which should prove at the very least interesting in a few years, if not helping me gain support.
