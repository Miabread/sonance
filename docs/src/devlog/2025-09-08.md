Converting this repository from solely housing the "book" into being a general purpose monorepo for the project. It makes sense I feel to keep everything in once spot, and the existing "book" is enough of a something to work from. Speaking of that, the "book" has gone from purely design notes to general purpose documentation. Now housing the starts of a bibliography (that I desperately need to organize), as well as this devlog, which should prove at the very least interesting in a few years, if not helping me gain support.

I also spent some time today starting the vscode extension, which gives us helpful things like syntax highlighting and basic convince features, but also will be an important stepping stone in getting the language server set up. This took some fumbling to get started and will likely take a lot of trial, error, and research to continue. Yay.
